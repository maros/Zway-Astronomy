# Zway-Astronomy

Zway Astronomy module for calculating the current solar position above the 
horizon. The module provides various metrics for other automation modules 
and emits events when the sun reaches certain positions.

For example, the solar altitude may be used in conjunction with the 
"Motion Trigger" module ( https://github.com/maros/Zway-MotionTrigger ) to 
trigger lights only if it is dark outside. Events emitted by this module 
(eg. astronomy.sunrise) can be caught and processed by the "Event Watcher"
( https://github.com/maros/Zway-EventWatcher ) module to trigger custom 
actions.

This module is required by the "Blind Control" module 
( https://github.com/maros/Zway-BlindControl ) which manages blinds for 
optimal shading.

# Configuration

## latitude,longitude

Geo coordinates for the used position

## createAzimuthDevice

If set to true, will create a device showing the current azimuth of the sun.

# Virtual Devices

This module creates a virtual device that displays the angle of the sun
above/below the horizon in degrees. Additionally the following metrics are 
set and can be accessed from other automation modules.

*    metrics:azimuth: Sun position degrees
*    metrics:altitude: Altitude above horizon
*    metrics:sunrise: Top edge of the sun appears on the horizon
*    metrics:sunriseEnd: Bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon
*    metrics:goldenHourEnd: Morning golden hour ends
*    metrics:solarNoon: Sun is in the highest position
*    metrics:goldenHour: Evening golden hour starts
*    metrics:sunsetStart: Bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon
*    metrics:sunset: Sun disappears below the horizon, evening civil twilight starts
*    metrics:dusk: Evening nautical twilight starts
*    metrics:nauticalDusk: Evening astronomical twilight starts
*    metrics:night: Night starts.dark enough for astronomical observations
*    metrics:nadir: Darkest moment of the night, sun is in the lowest position
*    metrics:nightEnd: Night ends. Morning astronomical twilight starts
*    metrics:nauticalDawn: Morning nautical twilight starts)
*    metrics:dawn: Morning nautical twilight ends, morning civil twilight starts
*    metrics:trend: 'rise' or 'set'

All metrics except azimuth, altitude and trend are stored as JavaScript Date
objects, and may lay in the past since they are only calculated for the
current day. The device icon indicates day/night.

If createAzimuthDevice config is enabled, then a second virtual device
will be created.

# Installation

The prefered way of installing this module is via the "Zwave.me App Store"
available in 2.2.0 and higher. For stable module releases no access token is 
required. If you want to test the latest pre-releases use 'k1_beta' as 
app store access token.

For developers and users of older Zway versions installation via git is 
recommended.

```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules
git clone https://github.com/maros/Zway-Astronomy.git Astronomy --branch latest
```

To update or install a specific version
```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/Astronomy
git fetch --tags
# For latest released version
git checkout tags/latest
# For a specific version
git checkout tags/1.02
# For development version
git checkout -b master --track origin/master
```
